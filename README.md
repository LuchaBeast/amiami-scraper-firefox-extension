# amiami Product Image Scraper
This is a small Firefox add-on I've created to easily and quickly download product images from amiami

## How to install
1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. In Firefox, type **about:debugging** into your url bar and then click 'This Firefox' on the resulting page.
3. Click the 'Load Temporary Add-on' button and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Once in the repository directory, open **manifest.json** to load the add-on into Firefox.
5. If successful, you should see the amiami icon appear in your extension bar.
5. Because the add-on is being loaded as temporary, it will only function during your current browser session. If you close and reopen Firefox, you will need to reload the add-on again via the same steps above.
